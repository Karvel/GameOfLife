# GameOfLife
Simple python script to create first iteration of Conway's Game of Life.


Rules to the Game of Life:

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
 
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
  
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


To-do:

* Output content to frame.

* Repaint frame with subsequent steps in algorithm.
